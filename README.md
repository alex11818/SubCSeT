### (Screening Tools for SUBsurface CO2 storage in petroleum reservoirs on the NCS)  

The repository contains codes, tools and data for screening CO2 storage potential of petroleum reservoirs on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) developed in [WP6 of the CSSR](https://cssr.no/research/fa3/wp-6/), namely:
1.  various public data  (**coming soon**), mostly retrived from [FactPages of the Norwegian Offshore Directorate](https://factpages.sodir.no/)  and [Public portal of DISKOS database](https://www.diskos.com/) 
2. Jupyter notebook (**coming soon**) details data retrival, processing and feature engineering workflows  
3. a **web app** to visualize the data and perform screening - **deployed at https://subcset-35e143428f88.herokuapp.com/**
