`(Screening Tools for SUBsurface CO2 storage in petroleum reservoirs on the NCS)`  
The repository contains tools and data for screening of CO2 storage potential of petroleum reservoirs on NCS used/developed in [WP6](https://cssr.no/research/fa3/wp-6/), namely:
*  various public data  (**coming soon**), mostly retrived from [FactPages of the Norwegian Offshore Directorate](https://factpages.sodir.no/)  and [Public portal of DISKOS database](https://www.diskos.com/) 
* Jupyter notebook (**coming soon**) that describes data retrival, processing and feature engineering workflows 
* web application to visualize and use the data for screening
