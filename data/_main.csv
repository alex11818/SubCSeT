TROLL,105,NORTH,producing,gas/oil,TROLL UNIT,Equinor Energy AS,False,"Troll contains very large amounts of gas resources and is also one of the largest oil producing fields on the Norwegian continental shelf. The field has two main structures: Troll Øst and Troll Vest. About two-thirds of the recoverable gas reserves lie in Troll Øst. The gas and oil reservoirs in the Troll Øst and Troll Vest structures consist primarily of shallow marine sandstone of Late Jurassic age in the Sognefjord Formation. Part of the reservoir is also in the underlying Fensfjord Formation of Middle Jurassic age. The field consists of three relatively large, rotated fault blocks. The eastern fault block constitutes Troll Øst. The reservoir depth at Troll Øst is 1330 metres. Pressure communication between Troll Øst and Troll Vest has been proven. Originally, the oil column in Troll Øst was mapped to be 0-4 metres thick. A well drilled in 2007 proved an oil column of 6-9 metres in the Fensfjord Formation in the northern segment of Troll Øst. The Troll Vest oil province originally had a 22 to 26-metre-thick oil column under a small gas cap, located at a depth of 1360 metres. The Troll Vest gas province originally had an oil column of 12-14 metres under a gas column of up to 200 metres. The oil column is now reduced to a thickness of only 1 to 5 metres. A significant volume of residual oil is encountered directly below the Troll Vest oil column.","Troll is a field in the northern part of the North Sea. The water depth is 300-330 metres. Troll was discovered in 1979, and the initial plan for development and operation (PDO) was approved in 1986. The plan was updated in 1990 and involved the transfer of gas processing to the Kollsnes terminal. The production started in 1995. A phased development was pursued for the Troll field, with Phase I recovering gas reserves in Troll Øst and Phase II focusing on the oil reserves in Troll Vest. Troll Phase I has been developed with Troll A, which is a fixed wellhead and compression platform with a concrete substructure. Troll A receives power from shore. The gas compression capacity at Troll A was increased in 2004/2005, and again in 2015. Troll Phase II was developed with Troll B, a floating concrete accommodation and production platform, and Troll C, a semi-submersible accommodation and production steel platform. The oil is produced from several subsea templates tied-back to Troll B and Troll C by flowlines. The production from Troll C started in 1999. The Troll C platform is also utilised for production from the Fram field. Several PDO amendments were approved in connection with various subsea templates at Troll Vest.
