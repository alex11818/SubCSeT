The field has two main structures: Troll Øst and Troll Vest. About two-thirds of the recoverable gas reserves lie in Troll Øst. The gas and oil reservoirs in the Troll Øst and Troll Vest structures consist primarily of shallow marine sandstone of Late Jurassic age in the Sognefjord Formation. Part of the reservoir is also in the underlying Fensfjord Formation of Middle Jurassic age. The field consists of three relatively large, rotated fault blocks. The eastern fault block constitutes Troll Øst. The reservoir depth at Troll Øst is 1330 metres. Pressure communication between Troll Øst and Troll Vest has been proven. Originally, the oil column in Troll Øst was mapped to be 0-4 metres thick. A well drilled in 2007 proved an oil column of 6-9 metres in the Fensfjord Formation in the northern segment of Troll Øst. The Troll Vest oil province originally had a 22 to 26-metre-thick oil column under a small gas cap, located at a depth of 1360 metres. The Troll Vest gas province originally had an oil column of 12-14 metres under a gas column of up to 200 metres. The oil column is now reduced to a thickness of only 1 to 5 metres. A significant volume of residual oil is encountered directly below the Troll Vest oil column.","The gas in Troll Øst is recovered by pressure depletion through 39 wells drilled from Troll A. The oil in Troll Vest is produced from long horizontal wells, which penetrate the thin oil zone directly above the oil-water contact. The recovery strategy is based primarily on pressure depletion, but this is accompanied by a simultaneous expansion of both the gas cap above the oil zone and the underlying water zone. Some gas is also reinjected.

Smørbukk Sør contains oil, gas and condensate in the Tilje, Ile and Garn Formations. The Midgard gas accumulation is divided into four structural segments, with the main reservoir in the Ile and Garn Formations. Blåbjørn contains oil at a depth of 3100 metres in the Upper Cretaceous Lysing Formation. The Blåbjørn reservoir is located above Smørbukk Sør.","Smørbukk and Smørbukk Sør are produced mainly by pressure depletion, with minor pressure support by gas injection. Midgard and Blåbjørn are produced by pressure depletion.",https://factpages.sodir.no/factpages/default.aspx?nav1=field&nav2=PageView|All&nav3=43765,2003.0,24.872,14.799,10.073,100.0,79.0,14.0,7.0,65.07484224,6.9066011000000005,2334.0,4113.7,4113.7,4955.0,290.9,4236.8,432.3,432.3,147.9,292.9,1.8284677496719934,0.0038863644967660747,362.04,1305.82,1667.86,0.78,189.54,800.76,990.3,635.04,20.54,6.35,641.0,6875.0,9936.0,,2556439.0,1.72,3065.0
