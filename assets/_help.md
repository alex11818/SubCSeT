# About
This is a web application for screening petroleum reservoirs on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) for purposes of CO2 storage, developed in [the Centre for Sustainable Subsurface Resources (CSSR)](https://cssr.no/) hosted by the Norwegian Research Centre (NORCE). The app is based on a study presented at the GHGT-17 conference (Calgary, October 2024): 
* [**e-poster**](https://api.ltb.io/show/ACGES) with a short presentation,
* [**conference paper**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5069175) with more details.
A short description is also presented below.

# Quick start
The large table in the left half presents data for the NCS fields:  
1. retrieved from [FactPages of the Norwegian Offshore Directorate] (https://factpages.sodir.no/)  
2. retrieved from [Public portal of DISKOS database](https://www.diskos.com/)  
3. indicators derived to assess the field suitability for CO2 storage.  
The table is interactive and can be filtered by any column.  

A quick reference on the table columns is given below in the "Glossary".
The table is uploaded from a csv-file specified in the path. 
The csv-file was generated by the Jupyterl notebook ([main.ipynb](https://github.com/cssr-tools/SubCSeT/blob/main/main.ipynb)).

The tabs to the right:  
+ MAP and a SCATTER plot to visualize selected table data.  
+ PARA-PLOT - parallel coordinates plot that allows to visualize many parameters and selected fields at once. One can use this tab to narrow down the search to a few reservoirs, based on several criteria, and track relations between various paramaters.  The table can be used to select parameters and define normalization settings:  
    + **log10** can be applied to data is the parameter's utility is believed to follow a logarithm  of the parameter value.   
    + **normalize** (default: None) allows to normalize the data by "z-score",  "mean", "median" or "min-max" (i.e. => min=0 and max=1).   
How to select data on the chart: 
    *  to set a limit along a dimension: hold left mouse button and move along an axis . Multiple segments can selected along the same or different axes.  
    * to remove a single segment: click on it
    * to remove all segments along an axis: double-click on the axis  
    * the list of selected fields shows up below the chart  
+ TOTAL SCORE - to sets rules to aggregate multiple features into a **total score** and rank the best candidates in the histogram below. The total score is calculated for all reservoirs, but only reservoirs selected in the table are rendered in the histogram. 
The total score is designed to be in range from 0 (absolutely terrible) to 100 (best-ever). **Negative weight** can be used to indicate that a parameter needs to be minimized (for example, *[CO2 SC]/[well num]* - storage capacity per legacy well).  In this case the parameter is first multiplied by -1 and then normalized. The **"only selected rows"** allows to limit the total score calculations to currently selected rows. These option allows to focus on a subset and/or exclude outliers.  

The icons above the table:
* ![](/assets/check2-square.svg) - add all filtered table rows to the selection
* ![](/assets/x-square.svg) - deselect all selected rows
* ![](/assets/arrow-90deg-down.svg) - add the fields selected in the current chart to the table selection  
* ![](/assets/gear-fill.svg) - setting, here you can adjust the colorscale, theme etc.

Details of the screening framework are to be found in **paper link**.

**NB! The presented table is based on the public data sources, which may be uncertain and subject to corrections. 
Moreover, many estimates and assumptions had to be made to fill data gaps and derive indicators, which may need to be revised despite our efforts to ensure data quality.
