# About
This is a web application for screening petroleum reservoirs on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) for purposes of CO2 storage, developed in [the Centre for Sustainable Subsurface Resources (CSSR)](https://cssr.no/) hosted by the Norwegian Research Centre (NORCE).

# Quick start
The large table in the left half presents data for the NCS fields:  
1. retrieved from [FactPages of the Norwegian Offshore Directorate] (https://factpages.sodir.no/)  
2. retrieved from [Public portal of DISKOS database](https://www.diskos.com/)  
3. indicators derived to assess the field suitability for CO2 storage.  
The table is interactive and can be filtered by any column.  

A quick reference on the table columns is given below in the "Glossary".
The table is uploaded from a csv-file specified in the path. 
The csv-file was generated by the Jupyterl notebook **[link to Github notebook]**.

The tabs to the right:  
+ MAP and a SCATTER plot to visualize selected table data.  
+ PARA-PLOT - parallel coordinates plot that allows to visualize many parameters and selected fields at once. How to use: 
    *  to set a limit along a dimension: hold left mouse button and move along an axis . Multiple segments can selected along the same or different axes.  
    * to remove a single segment: click on it
    * to remove all segments along an axis: double-click on the axis  
    * the list of selected fields shows up below the chart  
+ TOTAL SCORE - to design rules to aggregate multiple features into a **total score** and rank the best candidates in the histogram below.

The icons above the table:
* ![](/assets/check2-square.svg) - add all filtered table rows to the selection
* ![](/assets/x-square.svg) - deselect all selected rows
* ![](/assets/box-arrow-up-right.svg) - reopen the current chart in a new tab (does not work in the versio deployed in the cloud)
* ![](/assets/gear-fill.svg) - setting, here you can adjust the colorscale, theme etc.
* ![](/assets/question-lg.svg) - help (you are here)

Details of the screening framework are to be found in **paper link**.

**NB! The presented table is based on the public data sources, which may be uncertain and subject to corrections. 
Moreover, many estimates and assumptions had to be made to fill data gaps and derive indicators, which may need to be revised despite our efforts to ensure data quality.
