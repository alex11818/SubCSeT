# About
This is a web application for screening petroleum reservoirs on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) for purposes of CO2 storage, developed in [the Centre for Sustainable Subsurface Resources (CSSR)](https://cssr.no/) hosted by the Norwegian Research Centre (NORCE).

# Quick start
The large table in the left half presents data for the NCS fields:  
1. retrieved from [FactPages of the Norwegian Offshore Directorate] (https://factpages.sodir.no/)  
2. retrieved from [Public portal of DISKOS database](https://www.diskos.com/)
3. indicators derived to assess the field suitability for CO2 storage.  

Quick reference on the table columns is given below in the "Glossary".
The table is uploaded from a csv-file specified in the path. 
The csv-file was generated by the Jupyterl notebook **[link to Github notebook]**.

The icons above the table:
* ![](/assets/check2-square.svg) - add all filtered table rows to the selection
* ![](/assets/x-square.svg) - deselect all selected rows
* ![](/assets/box-arrow-up-right.svg) - reopen the current chart in a new tab
* ![](/assets/gear-fill.svg) - setting, here you can adjust the colorscale, theme etc.
* ![](/assets/question-lg.svg) - help (you are here)

Details of the screening framework are to be found in **paper link**.
The tabs in the right half contain:  
+ a map and a scatter plot to visualize table data  
+ an editor that allows to combine multiple features into *total score*

**NB! The presented table is based on the public data sources, which may be uncertain and subject to corrections. 
Moreover, many estimates and assumptions had to be made to fill data gaps and derive indicators, which may need to be revised despite our efforts to ensure data quality.
